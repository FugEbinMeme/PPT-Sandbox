PPT-Sandbox lets you modify all sorts of garbage parameters, add some scripts that do various things, and generally just fool around with the game.

All changes to your PPT client, if used online, will desync and give you a connection error - with the only exception being if your opponent is using the exact same setup (hence, the save/load feature). Some things don't work online, so they've been put into their own category under Scripts / Offline Only. I try to make everything work online but I don't have much to work with and PPT isn't put together very well, the fact that most things work online is a miracle.

Big props to [mat1jaczyyy](https://github.com/mat1jaczyyy), for teaching me some of the basics in WPF and C#.
