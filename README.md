A Puyo Puyo Tetris Trainer/Modding Tool

PPT-Sandbox lets you modify the garbage parameters, add some scripts that do various things, and generally just fool around with the game.

All changes to your PPT client, if used online, will desync and give you a connection error - with the only exception being if your opponent is using the exact same setup (hence, the save/load feature).

Big props to mat1jaczyyy, for teaching me some of the basics in WPF and C#
