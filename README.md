A Puyo Puyo Tetris Trainer/Modding Tool

Currently in pre-release, what's here mostly works and you are fine to compile and play around but the program is missing a lot of functionality that will be present in the first major release. Namely, a save/load feature, and as of writing, none of the dials do anything. Another thing I plan to add near release is a proper write-up on what some of the stuff is, as things like "Remove Perfect Clear Damage Cap" won't mean much to people who have no idea about the intricacies of PPT.

Translations to Japanese and Korean might also be a feature thats added in the future, but its a very low priority.

PPT-Sandbox lets you modify the garbage parameters, add some scripts that do various things, and generally just fool around with the game.

All changes to your PPT client, if used online, will desync and give you a connection error - with the only exception being if your opponent is using the exact same setup (hence, the save/load feature).

Big props to mat1jaczyyy, for teaching me some of the basics in WPF and C#
